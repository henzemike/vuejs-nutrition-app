                                    In order for our bodies to function properly and stay healthy, it is important that we follow a good nutritious diet. Foods are made up of 6 classes of nutrients. These nutrients are macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fats), micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) and water. If you neglect to have the right combination of these 6 items, it will be very difficult to live a healthy lifestyle and achieve your weight loss goals!
                                </p>

                                    To help educate others on the importance that all nutrients play in our daily lives from energy, sleep, workout recovery and the endless phase of aging! One of the most important things for you to understand about nutrition is the importance of micronutrients.  The foods we eat are either micronutrients or macronutrients. Micronutrients, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and phytochemicals, are essential in small amounts for healthy bodies since they are literally the ingredients of every cell in our body. The great news is that food like fruits and vegetables are full of micronutrients!

                                    New-Trition allows you the user to create and log your meals to help keep track not only of what you are eating but how nutrient packed each ingredient is in your meal. We have created an application to allow you to log your daily meals and display the total Macronutrients: protein, carbohydrates and fats, along with 5 important Micronutrients: magnesium, zinc, iron, folate and vitamin D! This will allow you to see the amount you are getting through the day and how much needs to be supplemented.

                                            Protein is an important component of every cell in the body. Hair and nails are mostly made of protein. Your body uses protein to build and repair tissues. You also use protein to make enzymes, hormones, and other body chemicals. Protein is an important building block of bones, muscles, cartilage, skin, and blood.

                                            Carbohydrates are your body’s main source of energy: They help fuel your brain, kidneys, heart, muscles and central nervous system. For instance, fiber is a carbohydrate that aids in digestion, helps you feel full and keeps blood cholesterol levels in check. Your body can store extra carbohydrates in your muscles and liver for use when you’re not getting enough carbohydrates in your diet. A carbohydrate-deficient diet may cause headaches, fatigue, weakness, difficulty concentrating, nausea, constipation, bad breath and vitamin and mineral deficiencies.

                                            Fats are a type of nutrient that you get from your diet. It is essential to eat some fats, though it is also harmful to eat too many. The fats you eat give your body energy that it needs to work properly. During exercise, your body uses calories from carbohydrates you have eaten. But after 20 minutes, exercise then depends on calories from fat to keep you going. You also need fat to keep your skin and hair healthy. Fat also helps you absorb vitamins A, D, E, and K, the so-called fat-soluble vitamins. Fat also fills your fat cells and insulates your body to help keep you warm. The fats your body gets from your food give your body essential fatty acids called linoleic and linolenic acid. They are called "essential" because your body cannot make them itself, or work without them. Your body needs them for brain development, controlling inflammation, and blood clotting.

                                            Magnesium is a cofactor in more than 300 enzyme systems that regulate diverse biochemical reactions in the body, including protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation. Magnesium is required for energy production, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis. It contributes to the structural development of bone and is required for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and the antioxidant glutathione. Magnesium also plays a role in the active transport of calcium and potassium ions across cell membranes, a process that is important to nerve impulse conduction, muscle contraction, and normal heart rhythm

                                            Zinc is found in cells throughout the body. It is needed for the body's defensive (immune) system to properly work. It plays a role in cell division, cell growth, wound healing, and the breakdown of carbohydrates. Zinc is also needed for the senses of smell and taste. During pregnancy, infancy, and childhood the body needs zinc to grow and develop properly. Zinc also enhances the action of insulin.

                                            Iron is an essential mineral which plays a key role in the making of healthy red blood cells. Without healthy red blood cells, your body doesn't get enough oxygen.  When you don’t get sufficient oxygen throughout your body, you're going to be exhausted, which can affect everything from your brain function to your immune system's ability to fight off infections.

                                            Folate is an important vitamin for metabolic, genetic and nervous system function. It is required for the formation of healthy red and white blood cells. Folate, which occurs naturally in foods like green leafy vegetables, is necessary for healthy growth and development. It has an important role in the production of nucleic acid and the metabolism of amino acids.

                                            Vitamin D is one of many nutrients our bodies need to stay healthy. Among the vitamin's main functions, it helps the body to absorb calcium. Vitamin D, along with calcium, helps build bones and keep bones strong and healthy. It also blocks the release of parathyroid hormone. This hormone reabsorbs bone tissue, which makes bones thin and brittle. Vitamin D may also play a role in muscle function and the immune system. The immune system is your body's defense system. It helps protect it against infections and other illnesses as well as to help improve you're mood.
